# Life-Expectancy-Analysis
A close look at the factors that influence global life expectancy

**Motivation:** Since industrialization in the early 1900s, global life expectancy has more than doubled, reaching 70 years on average. However, disparities persist between and within countries. A higher life expectency is linked to improved economic growth (GDP per capita). 

**Obejective:** This analysis will examine the key factors influencing life expectancy, including wealth distribution, healthcare access, education levels, environmental policies, and socioeconomic conditions. By evaluating these variables, we aim to determine which factor has the most significant impact on life expectancy.

## **Key Questions**

What are some of most important factors that influence a higher life expectancy?

Which regions of the world have a lower than average life expectancy?

How has factors influencing life expectancy changed over the years?

## **Methods and Tools Used**

**Pyhton:** Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, folium, sklearn, statsmodel, poltly.

**Tableau:** Visulization and analytical dashboard.

**Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis,

Linear Regression, 

k-means Clustering, 

Time Series, 

Geospatial Visualization
